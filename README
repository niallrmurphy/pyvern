This is pyvern, a network management and configuration consistency
checker written in python.

1. INSTALLATION

You'll need a bunch of python modules installed. At the very least you'll need:

* unittest2 (if running python < 2.7)
* ciscoconfparse
* py.test (not _absolutely_ necessary, but very handy).

2. RUNNING

To run it locally, install all the dependent modules, put your configs
in a local directory, then look at the Makefile for an invocation
pattern.

You can export the results to Hudson or similar with the default Makefile
action, which can produce a continuous build system that periodically pulls
down your router configs and checks them for correctness.

3. EXTENDING

Much of the power of the system comes from extending the basic checks provided
for in the core/ directory. To do this, look at the example files in the
directory "user_supplied".

To add parsing for a new "fact" about a router, look at
abstract_network_device to find out whether your pet whatsit is
present already. If not, find the appropriate place to add it, then
extend config_parse to parse it and set the relevant property.  Then
you can write a test about it. There's some useful functions in
test_infrastructure to allow you to do this. Don't forget you can mark
dependencies, which should help things run a bit faster/eliminate some
noise.
